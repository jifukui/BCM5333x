The Port Configuration screen defines speed, duplexing, and flow control operation for a port when auto-negotiation is off.
When auto-negotiation is on, those data are negotiated from the link partner. Otherwise, enable or disable ports to control
packet forwarding.<BR><BR>
<B>Port</B> specifies the port number to control.<BR><BR>
<B>Admin</B> enables or disables the port.<BR><BR>
<B>Auto Negotiation</B> enables or disables auto-negotiation. 
When auto-negotiation is enabled, the port negotiates with the link partner and 
works out speed, duplex operation, and flow control. When auto-negotiation is disabled, 
port speed, duplex operation, and flow control is programmable by the user.<BR><BR>
<B>Duplex Speed</B> controls duplex speed for the port.<BR><BR>
<B>PVID</B> assigns VLAN ID of packet when packets arrive at the port for untag packet or priority tag packet.<BR><BR>
