Port-Base QoS operation sets the priority relationships between four queues, selects the scheduling method for these queues,
associates packets of specific priorities to specific queues, and {1,2,4,8} "weight" for mapping from low to high queue.<BR><BR>
<B>Scheduling Method</B> specifies one scheduling methods (Weighted Round Robin) for the queues.<BR><BR>
<B>Queue [0:3]</B> specifies four queues. Queue 0 is the lowest priority queue, queue 3 is the highest priority queue. Packets in
queue 3 are served more often than packets in queue 0.<BR><BR>
<B>Ports</B> specifies each of ports<BR><BR>
<B>Weight</B> indicates the weight (number of packets) to be served in the queue before moving to serve next queue. A high priority
queue should have a higher weight than a low-priority queue.<BR><BR>
