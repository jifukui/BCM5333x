<B>Enable Loop Detection</B> enables or disables loop detection. 
When enabling Loop Detection, a special packet content with ethertype 0x8874, called loopdetect packet, is generated and sent to the front ports every two seconds. 
If this special packet is received by switch itself, a loop is detected. Otherwise, there is no loop in the topology. 
When a loop is detected by a port, both link and active LEDs on that port are switched to blinking mode until loop is removed. <BR><BR>
